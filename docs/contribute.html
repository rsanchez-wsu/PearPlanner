  <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
  <p>The Fall 2017 students of Mr. Sanchez' CEG-3120 class started out the semester working on several issues identified by Mr. Sanchez. As part of the course progression students were asked to identify issues or enhancements for RaiderPlanner. The objective is to incorporate some or all of these recommended changes throughout the course of the project.</p> 
  <h2>Special Features</h2>
  <p>The current implementation of RaiderPlanner (formerly PearPlanner) keeps the 4 central capabilities from the original project, along with implementation of several changes made by the CEG-3120 students. This planner can be used by a student to keep track of the major items due over the course of the semester, and includes tools allowing the user to add calendar reminders, make notes and assign tasks for each assignment.</p> 
  <h2>Our inspiration: Pearplanner</h2>
  <p>Credit for the original project goes to: Benjamin Dickson, Andrew Odintsov, Zilvinas Ceikauskas and Bijan Ghasemi Afshar</p>
  <h2>Want to find this project?</h2>
