 <h2>December 2016 Our Humble Beginnings</h2>
 <p>Students from the University of East Anglia located in Norwich, England took on a Study Planner project as part of their course work for
  "CMP-5012B - Software Engineering I". Which led to PearPlanner.</P>
 
<h2>RaiderPlanner A new project is Born</h2>
<p>RaiderPlanner is the PearPlanner's direct successor, a class project comprising most of the coursework for Wright State 
 University's "Introduction to the Design of IT Syetems" class (CEG 3120). The class uses GitHub as the file storage repository.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project is to implement a program containing the pertinent information from a given semester 
 (coursework, deadline information, exam information etc.) with a simple Graphical User Interface.</p>

<h2>Capabilities
 4 major ones:</h2>
<p>
    1.Load module, coursework and deadline information from a defined file format.
    2.Define study tasks, details, milestones and deadlines.
    3.Record study activities that contribute towards completing study tasks and milestones.
    4.Visualize activities, dependencies, intermediate milestones and deadlines using Gantt chart representation as well as a study progress dashboard that highlights upcoming deadlines and progress towards completing milestones and time spent for each module.
