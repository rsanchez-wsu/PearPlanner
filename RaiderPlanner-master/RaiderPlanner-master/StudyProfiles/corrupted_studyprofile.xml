                <name>Tony Bagnall 2.0</name>
                <details>Tony joined CMP as a part time MRes student/part time teaching assistant in 1993 having finished his BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Hertfordshire. After completing his Masters by research in 1995 he began a PhD titled "Modelling the UK electricity market with autonomous adaptive agents". After a brief period as a research assistant on a data mining project sponsored by Master Foods and Centrica, in 1999 he completed his PhD and was appointed as a Lecturer in Statistics for Data Mining jointly in the schools of Computer Science and Mathematics. In 2003 statistics moved into CMP and since then Tony has been a full member of the school. In 2007 he was promoted to senior lecturer.</details>

                <details>My principal research interests lie in machine learning, with a particular emphasis on Bayesian and kernel learning methods. I am most interested in theoretical issues and algorthms with a direct impact in the practical application of machine learning techniques, including topics such as feature selection, model selection, performance estimation, model comparison, covariate shift, dealing with imbalanced or "non-standard" data and semi-supervised learning. Most of my applied work centres on problems arising in computational biology, in collaboration with the School of Chemistry and Pharmacy (CAP) and with the nearby John Iness Centre (JIC) and Institute for Food Reasearch (IFR). However I also have long-standing research links with the School of Environmental Sciences (ENV) and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU), working on applications of machine learning in the environmental sciences, particularly on modelling and exploiting predictive uncertainty.</details>

                <details>Rudy Lapeer obtained an MSc in Mechanical Engineering with Distinction at University College Ghent (Belgium) in July 1988. His first job was as a production engineer at VOLVO Cars Europe in Ghent where he worked for three years. In 1992 he moved back to academia and took up the post of Software Engineer at the Department of Medical Informatics, University of Ghent (RUG). Meanwhile he embarked on a part-time MSc degree in Computer Science which he completed in 1993 with Distinction. He was then offered a Research Associate position at the University of Cambridge, working on the EU funded project Euro-Punch which involved the prediction of adverse pregnancy outcomes from clinical data. He started a PhD at the Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge in 1996, funded by the EPSRC, which he successfully completed in 1999. He was subsequently offered a Senior Research Fellowship at the Department of Medical Physics and Bio-engineering at University College London (UCL) working on an EPSRC funded project on augmented reality surgical navigation (CASSPAR). In 2001 he also worked as a Software Consultant for the UCL based company MTT (Medical Technology Transfer). In 2002, he was appointed as a Lecturer at the School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia. In the academic year 2007-8, he received the UEA’s Award for Excellence in Teaching. He was promoted to the position of Senior Lecturer in 2010.</details>

                <details>Stephen was appointed as a Lecturer in January 2005 and is part of the Graphics, Vision and Speech Lab.
                    He was promoted to Senior Lecturer in August 2012.
                    Stephen's research interests include Haptic Rendering, Collision Detection, Deformable objects and Real-time rendering. He is also interested in the application of new graphics techniques to Cultural Heritage, scientific visualisation and virtual training simulations. His research into haptic rendering led to a book chapter on the subject included in the book titled "Haptic Rendering: Foundations, Algorithms and Applications" edited by Ming Lin and Miguel Otaduy. His research in this area continues with the development of novel haptic rendering algorithms suitable for Molecular Graphics. Software based on these algorithms is available for download from http://www.haptimol.co.uk. The latest features of HaptiMOL ISAS are shown in the video.

                <name>Joost Noppen</name>
                <details>Joost Noppen is lecturer in Software Engineering at the University of East Anglia in Norwich (UK). Joost holds an M.Sc. degree and a Ph. D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Twente in the Netherlands with a special focus on computational intelligence in Software Engineering. Joost has held positions in leading Software Engineering research groups across Europe, such as the École des Mines and the University of Lancaster, where he has worked in international research projects. In 2008 Joost was awarded a prestigious Marie Curie Intra-European fellowship from the EU for his work on Software Product Line development.
                    Within the School of Computing Sciences Joost is responsible for the Software Engineering aspect of the teaching curriculum. He has been responsible for the complete redesign of the Software Engineering modules and bringing them up to date with state of the art in industrial software design and academic research. His modules focus on providing students with the fundamental skills for software development, such as object-orientation, and agile and test-driven development, combined with research-led topics and novel developments in industry such as mobile applications and software product lines.
                    The long-standing research interest of Joost is in decision support for modelling and analysing design information during the development of software systems. This includes questions such as: is it possible to reconstruct software designs from partial documentation? How can you optimise the quality and extensibility of software systems when faced with uncertain change scenarios? Can historical data of software projects be used to steer the design of new systems? Most of Joost's research has resulted in advanced modelling techniques for capturing and reasoning with imprecise and uncertain design information based on probability and fuzzy set theory that support software development activities.
                    Joost has over 14 years experience in Software Engineering both from an academic and industrial perspective. He has founded a successful web development company as a student and he has developed software in collaboration with multi-national companies. In his spare time Joost is exploring the application of Software Engineering principles to mobile games development practice.
                    Currently Joost is involved in a variety of Software Engineering activities both related to research and teaching and he is happy to be approached for projects in these areas. He is also available for consultancy, advice and assessment in the field of industrial software engineering.

                <details>In 1994 Ben moved to BT Laboratories in the speech recognition group, where he specialised in noise and channel robustness and front-end processing. In particular he worked on reducing error rates for services such as automated directory enquiries and speech recognition from payphones. More recent work at BT considered the effect of performing speech recognition over mobile and IP networks where problems of packet loss and codec distortion are addressed. He was also responsible for the handwriting component of BT's SmartQuill which features in the Guinness Book of Records as 'the world's most intelligent pen!'. He was also involved in work to automatically detect the internal rotting of telephone poles. He holds three patents in the areas of speech processing and handwriting recognition.
                    In March 2001 Ben returned to the School of Information Systems (now the School of Computing Sciences) as a Senior Lecturer.
                    Ben has also spent some time in oil and gas exploration working on side scan sonar and seabed profiling.
