It is large enough to allow at least twenty students to work and its walls are lined with pickled animals in glass jars.[2] In one corner of the room stands a basin into which ice-cold water pours from a gargoyle's mouth, while in another is a student supply cupboard. There is also a blackboard on which the Potions master can write the class's instructions. The room is especially cold, particularly in the winter when students are able to see their own breath.</details>

                <details>Charms is a core class and subject taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Unsurprisingly, it specialises in the teaching of charms. Even though mastering the science of charmwork is clearly essential to performing the greater part of magic, charmwork is seen as a "softer option" by some such as Augusta Longbottom who, incidentally, failed her Charms.</details>
